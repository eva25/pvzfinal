				<h3>About</h3>
					<p>
					The creators of the famous game Plants vs. Zombies have created a new version of the game called Plants vs. Zombies Adventures, which means plants vs zombies adventure.
					Basically meaning the game is not changed, you 'll like the first gay farmer who wants to protect themselves from attack by zombies. The game itself is similar to the strategy genre with the protection of the track, but here it is the farmer must defend his home.
					</p>
					<p>
					As before you will put plants that can shoot and sunflowers that bring you more sun. All the zombies will come out of their graves nearby. 
					Also added a lot of new locations, they are all very colorful, vibrant and more. Along with the locations were added, and a new, more powerful zombies, as well as new plants that will be able to stop even the crowd of creatures.
					</p>
				<h3>Difference between PvZ</h3>
					<p>Because of the different layout of Plants vs. Zombies Adventures compared to Plants vs. Zombies, several things were changed to the idea of plants so that they accommodate the 3D conversion.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Plants (except for Wall-nut, Hard-nut and Popcorn) do not get eaten. Instead, they get knocked out about five seconds, giving the plant 25 sun will revive it so the plant can attack zombies again.</li>
						<li>Plants are finite per level. The player will be given a maximum of five for a certain plant type, so placing plants in safe but practical spots is more important than in its predecessor.</li>
						<li>Plants have to be grown in the Player's Town. Not all plants are equal in this aspect.</li>
						<li>Because the game is 3D, plants attack the zombies in a square pattern rather than a line. If multiple zombies are in a plant's square, it will attack the one farthest from the starting Grave. If a zombie is eating a plant, the plant will prioritize the zombie eating it.</li>
					</ul>
