				<h3>About</h3>
						<p>
						The most notable change in Plants vs. Zombies Online is the town feature and a Player vs. Player (PvP) system. 
						The town is place the player lives with thousands of other players and the player can choose to befriend them. PvP allows the player to battle their friends in the classic Plants vs. Zombies versus mode. 
						The player uses the plants they have developed to compete with others.
						</p>
						<p>
						In terms of art style and gameplay features, it is more or less identical to Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time. However, unlike it, it is a PC game with an online component with special gameplay elements of its own.
						</p>
						<p>
						The game has three modes: a Town-building Mode where the player can unlock buildings and have a garden to grow and develop plants and make items; Normal Mode where the player defends his or her house from zombies around the worlds with plants; and the Adventure Mode which is a brand new mode. 
						Its gameplay is a little like the popular mobile TCG "I AM MT". The player form his or her own plants troop to battle against AI, as many as seven plant units which includes one from the player's friend can be sent into battle.
						</p>
